                            <div class="question"><p>What is a static web page, and how is it different from other types of websites?</p> <span class="down"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span></div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>A static web page is a basic type of website that consists of fixed content and doesn't change dynamically. Its content is created and stored in HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript files. Unlike dynamic websites, which use server-side scripting to generate content on-the-fly, static web pages deliver the same content to all users. They are well-suited for simple websites with relatively stable unchanged content.</p></div>

                            <div class="question"><p>How do I view my website once it's built? What's the difference between local and live sites?</p> <span class="down"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span></div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>Once your website is built, you can view it by opening the HTML file in a web browser  like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, usually by double clicking on HTML file your default browser will open it. When you are developing the website on your computer, you're viewing it locally. It's essential to test and preview the website locally before making it live (accessible to the public). To make it live, you'll need to upload the files to a web server using web hosting services.</p></div>

                            <div class="question"><p>What is web hosting, and do I need it for a static web page? How does it work?</p> <span class="down"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span></div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>Web hosting is a service that allows your website's files to be stored and accessible on the Internet. For a static web page, you do need web hosting to make your site accessible to others. Hosting companies provide server space where you can upload your HTML, CSS, and other files. When someone accesses your website, their browser requests those files from the hosting server, and the server sends the content back to be displayed in their browser.</p></div>

                            <div class="answer"><p>The difference between static webpages and dynamic ones is that static webpages don’t have a CMS system like WordPress. That allows users without coding skills to edit and change their website that’s the con of having a static website. On the other hand, static webpages are faster and more secure as you don’t have a database to protect. which is a major surface for cyber attacks. I can add variables to the code for changing important data like contact details. Overall if you don’t change your code often there are not many benefits of using a dynamic page. </p></div>

                            <div class="question"><p>Can I edit the content on my static website myself, or do I need to hire someone to do it for me?</p> <span class="down"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span></div>
                            <div class="answer"><p>Yes, you can edit the content on your static website yourself. Since static web pages are typically built using HTML and CSS, you don't need advanced technical knowledge to make changes. Basic text and image changes can be done by directly modifying the HTML files. I can show an example contact page where you can change the contact details with JAVASCRIPT or PHP variables. However, if you feel uncomfortable making changes yourself, you can ask me to assist you. </p></div>

                            <div class="answer"><p> please provide me with a detailed list of the sections on your website that you wish to have dynamic content using PHP or JavaScript variables. These sections might include valuable content such as contact forms, contact details, promotional banners, important announcements, or any other content you'd like to update easily without relying on technical assistance. </p></div>

                            <div class="answer"><p>it's essential to feel confident before hosting your live website. To alleviate any worries and help you gain experience, I have set up a dedicated free demo page where you can practice making content changes and familiarize yourself with the hosting process. you can edit the HTML file with Notepad or install a free code editing software such as visual studio code. </p></div>

                            <div class="answer"><p>Yes, static web pages are generally accessible on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. However, it's essential to ensure that your website is responsive, meaning it adapts its layout and design to fit different screen sizes. Responsive design ensures a user-friendly experience for visitors accessing your site from various devices.</p></div>

                            <div class="answer"><p>A domain name is the address used to access your website on the internet (www.example.com). For a static website, you can use a domain name to make it easier for people to find and remember your site. It's not mandatory to have one, as you can still access your site using the hosting server's IP address. However, a domain name is recommended for a more professional experience. When choosing a domain name, opt for something relevant to your website's content, easy to spell, and easy to remember.</p></div>
